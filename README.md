# Welcome to our project Ex3_oop!
This is an assignment from OOP course at Ariel University. In the last project we created Graph Algorithems infrastructure, 
in this project we used the last project to create a game that contains 24 different games. Each game have a map (which is a graph) and 
on that map there are several fruits and robots(depens on the selected level). Each game can be play manually or automatically, and the
main purpose of the game is to earn the most points in the least moves.
